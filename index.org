This is the homepage to the notes I created for Physics.

** Year 3

Note: Please forgive me for putting "it can be shown that..." everywhere - I hate that line as much as you do (along with "it is trivial" or "it can be shown as an exercise") but this is supposed to be the most important formulas and not full notes.
